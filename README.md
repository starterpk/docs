# Starter Pack Documentation

## What is Starter Pack?

Unifies all the other CLI tools. Forget having to install/remember/google lots of different
commands, access them all through Starter Pack!

This also means you don't have to worry about always keeping the various CLI tools you use up to
date because Starter Pack will take care of it for you. Keep Starter Pack up to date and all your
other CLI tools will be as well!

Not comfortable with using the Terminal/Command Line? Or just prefer GUIs instead? Use the Starter
Pack GUI tool instead!

(Coming Soon) Starter Pack is extendable. Is there a certain set up you'd like to add? No problem,
just add it in our starterpack.json/starterpackrc

(Coming Soon) Introduces you to new tool/technologies (by seeing different packs in the terminal/gui
that you might not have seen/heard/tried before)

(Coming Soon) Promotes best practices. We're so much more than just a tool. We strive to ensure that
any tech you build is done so in the best way possible. That's why we provide every set up with a
collection of best practices that you can refer to as you build. We won't hold your hand and guide
you every step of the way, we'll simply add some documentation to each pack that you can refer to
whenever you want. And if you'd rather do it your own way, that's fine too - just say 'no' when
asked - or tag --no-docs when running a command
